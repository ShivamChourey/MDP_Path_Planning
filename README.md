# Path Planning Simulation Project (MDP )
This repository contains the MATLAB code to devise an optimal policy for the motion of the robot given the obstacles and world boundaries.
This file contains an implementation to a specific environment wiht known parameters and obstacles, but can easily be modified or generalized for any environment. The code was linked to the V-Rep simulation environment and tested. 

A video of the VREP Simulation using the implementation from this repository is available at the following YouTube link: \
