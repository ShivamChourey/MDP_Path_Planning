# Path Planning Simulation Project (MDP )
A piece of MATLAB code that was used to devise an optimal policy for the motion of the robot given the obstacles and world boundaries.
The code is written in MATLAB, and is simulated in VREP environment. The code is written for a specific environment with obstacles.
